                  <h2>Why Moringa</h2>
                  <p>   Having thought myself how to code using PHP and mysql, i strongly felt i was limiting myself to back-end web development. i therefore needed to know more about front end development which would also be a strong entry point into mobile development. My research on coding school in East Africa put no doubt in my mind that Moringa was the best. Particularly, it has the kind of learning approach i have been yearning for in all my coding history.
                  after leaving Moringa-prep, i hope to have laernt more about javascript and develope a few application to showcase, join Core and learn mobile developement. and finally finish the program as a developer who can readily and compatetively solve computing problems in the real world

      <h3><strong>My take on recent and future technologies and what they hold for the future generations</strong></h3>
      <p> I tend to think the internet of things is both revolutionary and evolutionary. in many parts of the world it is slowly being absorped and it is only a matter of time before it blows up just like the internet did two decades ago. this is because many people will find it a necessity to intergrate many of theire activities in various platforms by the internet. However, almost as much efficiency it brings to the users, comes a few challenges that will have to be addressed to make it more appealing and purpose-serving. key among these is security. the cyber security needs to be improved. IoT present the real challenge of securing user information and privacy due to the many devices and platforms of entry with the user information.As such, it is difficult to keep track of these devices all the time and ensure they are </p>
